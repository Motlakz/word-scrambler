## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Click on the Random button to generate random words to guess
- Click on the Reset button to clear out the inputs and count functions
- Guess what word is randomly scrambled and displayed on the input

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript promises and DOM Manipulation

### What I learned

I learned how to make a word scrambler by iterating through a list of small inputs that populate the larger input with the word that is provided in the placeholder. I learned to show the incorrect letter on the 'mistakes' element and count the number of tries at the same time. Jumping from one input to another depending on the index of the letter that is typed and using reverse iteration to delete each letter accordingly. Creating a text gradient effect.

### Continued development

I will always take every opportunity to hone my JavaScript Skills from intermediate to advanced concepts. I hope to grow into frameworks as I build.
